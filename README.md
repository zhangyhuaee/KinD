This is a Tensorflow implementation of KinD

### The [KinD++](https://github.com/zhangyhuaee/KinD_plus) is an improved version. ###

To better adapt to TensorFlow 2.0, we modified our code.Now you can run this code directly using TensorFlow 2.0.
### Requirements ###
1. Python
2. Tensorflow >= 2.0
3. numpy, PIL

### Test ###
First download the pre-trained checkpoints from [BaiduNetdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c4ZLYEIoR-8skNMiAVbl_A) or [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-ljWntl7FExf6BSQtl5Mz3rMGWgnXDz4), then just run
```shell
python evaluate.py
```
Our pre-trained model has changed. Thus, the results have some difference with the report in our paper. However, you can adjust the illumination ratio to get better results.

### Train ###
The original LOLdataset can be downloaded from [here](https://daooshee.github.io/BMVC2018website/). We rearrange the original LOLdataset and add several all-zero images to improve the decomposition results and restoration results. The new dataset can be download from [BaiduNetdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1sn3vWJ2I5U2dlVUD7eqIBQ) or [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-MaOVG7ylOkmGv1K4HWWcrai01i_FeDK). Save training pairs of LOL dataset under './LOLdataset/our485/' and save evaluating pairs under './LOLdataset/eval15/'. For training, just run
```shell
python decomposition_net_train.py
python adjustment_net_train.py
python reflectance_restoration_net_train.py
```
You can also evaluate on the LOLdataset, just run
```shell
python evaluate_LOLdataset.py
```
Our code partly refers to the [code](https://github.com/weichen582/RetinexNet).
